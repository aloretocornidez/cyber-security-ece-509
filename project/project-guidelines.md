# Proposed Topics 

- Threat detection
    – Network threat detection and analysis on existing cybersecurity datasets like NSLKDD, or UNSWNB-15 (https://research.unsw.edu.au/projects/unsw-nb15-dataset).
- Insider threat detection
    – Insider threat detection and analysis on threat detection [datasets](https://resources.sei.cmu.edu/library/asset-view.cfm?assetid=508099).
- Email worm attacks
    – Develop and execute a worm attack that will be transmitted over email
- Metasploit.
    – Create an exploit for a Windows10 machine using Metasploit Penetration testing software.
- PDF file scripting
    – Create a malicious PDF file that will execute a malicious script when opened
- Anomaly Behavior Analysis of Encrypted Network Traffic
    – Network traffic analysis is the process of monitoring and inspecting network traffic to identify malicious activity. This can be done using a variety of tools and techniques.
